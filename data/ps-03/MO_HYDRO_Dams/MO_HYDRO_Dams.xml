<abstract>This dataset developed by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. This data set contains the locations of regulated and non-regulated dams in Missouri. 2019 update.</abstract>
<purpose>One of the missions of the Dam and Reservoir Safety Program is to ensure that dams in the state are constructed, maintained and operated in a safe manner. This is accomplished by regulation of all non-agricultural, non-federal dams 35 feet or more in height and by providing technical assistance and informational resources to all dam owners</purpose>
<supplinf>The metadata content associated with this data set was reviewed by Elizabeth Retherford on 20190118.  The metadata content review is intended to ensure that all of the required content is present.  The components comprising the metadata document were reviewed by Elizabeth Retherford on 20190118.  The metadata component review is intended to ensure that required metadata components are consistent and understandable to data consumers.</supplinf>

<attrlabl>SECTNSHPRN</attrlabl>
<attrdef>The Section, Township, and Range that the dam is located in based on the Public Land Survey System (PLSS).  The source for this data was estimated during the original dam inventory from the early 1980Ã¢&#128;&#153;s and has been updated as new dams are added.  The format is S for section followed by a two digit number, T for township followed by a two digit number followed by a N for north, R for range followed by a two digit number followed by an E or W for east or west.  Some dams that are located within a land grant have the same format except the section is replaced by LG for land grand followed by the land grant number and the township and range designations are inferred from nearby sections.</attrdef>
</attr>
<attr>
<attrlabl>ID_NO</attrlabl>
<attrdef>The official identification (ID) number for the dam. This is a required field and must have an entry for each dam included in the database.  This field is used as the unique identifier for each dam record. The first two characters of the identity are the state two-letter abbreviation, based on the location of the dam. The last five characters of the identity are a unique number (AB#####).  The ID number is the Corps Identification Number assigned to each dam in the 1995-96 National Inventory of Dams (NID) update, under the National Dam Inspection Program (P.L. 92-367). Once assigned, this number should not be changed. However, the following guidelines are provided for assignment of ID numbers for new dams. Each new dam will be assigned an NID ID number by the state or federal coordinator. NID ID numbers will not be reused. If a dam is retired or is otherwise no longer in existence, that ID number is retired. The state coordinator is responsible for assigning ID numbers for all dams, regardless of ownership. The numbers may not necessarily be continuous, because of a previously established scheme, which assigned certain number ranges to federal agencies. Continued use of this numbering scheme for new dams is at the discretion of the state coordinator. Please contact Association of State Dam Safety Officials (ASDSO) or United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Dam Safety Team for further information on the process of assigning NID ID numbers or if an alternative number sequence is necessary to meet the needs of the state.</attrdef>
